    "\n",
    "### Code design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Organise your code using **python classes** and carry out the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Place the metals and diffusivities in a python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(bx2)** Create a simulation initialisation routine where e.g. the mesh, the initial conditions, and the boundary conditions are all set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two types of **initial conditions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smooth**, which sets the initial temperature profile in degrees Celsius to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(x, 0)= 175 - 50\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{5}\\right) - x^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is in units of $\\rm cm$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noisy**, which adds some noise $f(x)$ with amplitude $\\beta$ to the initial condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(x, 0)= 175 - 50\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{5}\\right) - x^2 + \\beta\\,f(x)\\,g(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you need to find an appropriate apodisation function $g(x)$ so that the initial boundary conditions remain fixed at $25\\,\\rm C$. Similarly, a default amplitude for the noise function can be set to be less than a hundredth of the peak temperature value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, consider two types of **boundary conditions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed**, which keep the temperatures at the edges of the metal wire fixed at a temperature of $25\\,\\rm C$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Varying**, which assume that the boundaries cannot be kept constant (because of e.g. a faulty cooling system). Instead they also evolve in time according to the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $T(+10\\,{\\rm cm}, t) = 25 + 0.12\\,t$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $T(-10\\,{\\rm cm}, t) = 25 + 0.27\\,t$\n",
    "\n",
    "**(cx3)** Construct a Crank-Nicolson algorithm to simulate **the evolution of an initial temperature profile** and find the **time in seconds at which thermal equilibrium is reached** in an input metal wire (from the dictionary). **Hint:** You need to define some criteria to determine thermal equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smooth-Fixed Simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Pick **two metal wires** from the dictionary and run both simulations using your Crank-Nicolson algorithm. To compare the results, make a high-quality, 2-column figure showing the time evolution of the 1D temperature profile, $T=T(x, t)$, of each metal wire versus $x$ at a few selected times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smooth-Fixed versus Noisy-Fixed Simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Study heat diffusion only in the Zinc wire considering **smooth versus noisy initial conditions** with noise of 3 different amplitudes. To compare the results, make a high-quality, 4-panel figure (with 2 columns and 2 rows) showing the time evolution of the 1D temperature profile, $T=T(x, t)$, of the Zinc metal wire versus $x$ at a few selected times, under different initial conditions (smooth vs. 3 noisy cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smooth-Fixed versus Smooth-Varying Simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)** Study heat diffusion only in the Aluminum wire considering **fixed versus varying boundary conditions**. To compare the results, make a high-quality, 2-column figure showing the time evolution of the 1D temperature profile, $T=T(x, t)$, of the Aluminum metal wire versus $x$ at a few selected times, under different boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(g)** Can we use explicit or FFT methods to solve this problem? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(h)** Does the input noise amplitude change the time at which thermal equilibrium is reached or not? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)** What is the effect of a faulty cooling system on the temperature profile?"

    "## 2. Joblib Parallelisation (8 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the same statement provided in problem 1. All code should be organised in **python classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallelisation with joblib:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Imagine we wish to run several simulations in parallel for the metals included in the dictionary. Within the **metalconduction.ipynb** notebook, create a routine that uses ```joblib``` to parallelise the simulation executions in $n$ CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Test your implementation by running $2$ simulations ($1$ for Iron and $1$ for Lead) first in serial and then in parallel (simultaneously). For the serial run, $n=1$ CPU core. For the parallel run, $n=2$ CPU cores. The time should go down. **Hint:** You need to add time stamps to quantify and return log files with the execution times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Make a scaling plot showing (serial and parallel) execution times in the $Y$ axis versus the number of CPU cores ($n$) in the $X$ axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HPC execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Convert your notebook code into a script called: **metalconduction.py**. Then, copy it to the CEDIA cluster (or the Imbabura cluster), reserve computing resources (e.g. $8$ CPU cores), then run your code in serial and parallel for all the $8$ metals at increasing $n$ (e.g. $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$ CPU cores). Export log files from each run, so that the thermal equilibrium times and simulation run times can be analysed later. Include the log files and all your SLURM job scripts in the **outputfolder.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Within the **metalconduction.ipynb** notebook, create a routine to open the log files produced by the serial run and all the different parallel runs on the HPC cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)** Make a plot showing the thermal equilibrium times versus diffusivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(g)** Make a new scaling plot for the HPC cluster showing the executions times on the Y-axis and number of cores on the X-axis. Display also the **Amdahl's law**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(h)** Compare the Amdahl's law to your results and comment on the findings (e.g. does your parallelisation follow Amdahl's law? Why yes or no?)"
