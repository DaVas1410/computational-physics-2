    "## 1. Finite-difference method for quantum mechanics: Wave packets in a Parabolic Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a quantum mechanical particle of mass $m$ constrained to move along the x-axis. Its dynamics are governed by the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} + V(x) \\Psi(x,t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Psi(x,t)$ represents the quantum state of the particle, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$ is the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator potential with $\\omega$ representing the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "At time $t=0$, you will explore two different initial wavefunctions for the particle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Single Gaussian Wave Packet:** A localized wave packet with an initial momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Psi(x,0) = A e^{-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} e^{i p_0 x / \\hbar}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_0$ is the initial position, $\\sigma$ is the width, and $p_0$ is the initial momentum. $A$ is a normalization constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Superposition of Two Gaussian Wave Packets:** It is formed by the sum of two distinct Gaussian wave packets:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Psi(x,0) = A_1 e^{-\\frac{(x-x_{0,1})^2}{2\\sigma_1^2}} e^{i p_{0,1} x / \\hbar} + A_2 e^{-\\frac{(x-x_{0,2})^2}{2\\sigma_2^2}} e^{i p_{0,2} x / \\hbar}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_{0,k}$ are initial positions, $\\sigma_k$ are widths, $p_{0,k}$ are initial momenta for each packet, and $A_k$ are constants adjusted such that the total wavefunction $\\Psi(x,0)$ is **normalised**, meaning $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\Psi(x,0)|^2 dx = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will simulate the particle in a finite spatial domain, $[-L_x/2, L_x/2]$. At the boundaries of this domain, we will apply **Dirichlet boundary conditions**, meaning the wavefunction is identically zero: $\\Psi(-L_x/2, t) = \\Psi(L_x/2, t) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to develop and implement a numerical algorithm to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation using the **Crank-Nicolson method** that we reviewed in class:\n",
    "\n",
    "## (a) Mathematical derivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a markdown cell, derive the discrete form of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation using the **Crank-Nicolson method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Begin by discretising the spatial domain ($x_j = j \\Delta x$) and time ($t_n = n \\Delta t$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a central finite difference approximation for the second spatial derivative. Your derivation should lead to a matrix equation of the form $\\mathbf{A} \\Psi^{n+1} = \\mathbf{B} \\Psi^n$, where $\\Psi^{n+1}$ and $\\Psi^n$ are vectors of the wavefunction at interior grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly define the elements of the tridiagonal matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ in terms of $\\hbar$, $m$, $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta t$, and $V_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show how the discrete Hamiltonian operator $\\mathbf{H}$ is represented within these matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (b) Python code implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **python classes** to implement the numerical solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. You will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up the physical constants, simulation parameters, spatial and temporal grids, and the potential. The simulation should be conducted using atomic units, where $\\hbar = 1$ and $m = 1$. This simplifies the equations without loss of generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement the initial conditions described above ensuring the proper normalisation of the initial wavefunctions. Remember that the wavefunction $\\Psi$ is complex, so you should ensure that all calculations involving $\\Psi$ handle complex numbers correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct the tridiagonal matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ based on your derivations. Pay close attention to the boundary conditions. **Hint:** Use sparse matrices for computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a time evolution loop. At each time step, calculate the RHS vector $\\mathbf{B} \\Psi^n$. Solve the linear system $\\mathbf{A} \\Psi^{n+1} = (\\text{RHS vector})$, and update the wavefunction array $\\Psi$ for the next iteration, remembering to apply the boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c) Simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your code for both initial conditions. First, you should run it for the **Single Gaussian Wave Packet** and then for the **Superposition of Two Gaussian Wave Packets**. For each case, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate a plot showing snapshots of the probability density $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$ at several times. Include the potential $V(x)$ on the same plot (scaled appropriately for visibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a 2D map and a 3D representation showing the evolution of the probability density $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$ as a function of both position $x$ and time $t$. This plot should capture the entire simulation duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create animated visualisation of the probability density of the wave packet evolving in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (d) Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the dynamics of the single Gaussian wave packet versus the superposition of two Gaussians. In particular, discuss what phenomena occur when the two Gaussian components of the superposition interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate and report the total probability (norm) $\\sum_j |\\Psi_j^{N_t}|^2 \\Delta x$ at the final time step of each simulation. Compare it to the initial norm. Discuss if the Crank-Nicolson method conserves the norm, and why small deviations might still occur in practice.\n"
